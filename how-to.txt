Steps to reproduce the setup from Lab 1
=======================================

1. Pass the regex/grammar jj file to JTB:
    java -jar jtb.jar miniexpr.jj

2. Generate parser using JavaCC:
    javacc jtb.out.jj

3. To view the grammar file in a browser, generate an html as follows:
    jjdoc miniexpr.jj

3. Edit any existing visitor (such as GJDepthFirst.java). Make sure the correct one is named in Main.java.

4. Compile your code:
    javac Main.java

5. Test out the parser:
    java Main < test

6. Edit the jj file, recreate the parser, design new programming languages, enjoy!
